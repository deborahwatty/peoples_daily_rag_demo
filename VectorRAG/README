# Custom timeframe 
If you would like to use VectorRAG on a different time frame or a set of articles generated with the sentiment analysis tool, you can use chroma_embed.py to create a new datastore. 

1. Convert your data to .tsv and ensure it has a merged_content column containing both the title and text. 

2. Change the file path in chroma_embed.tsv and run the script. 

3. Change the datastore file path in chroma_rag_final.py.
